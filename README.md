## üõ†Ô∏è **Process & Methodology**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Standardized inconsistent date formats to `MM-DD-YYYY` using Pandas.  
   - Processed missing values to maintain a consistent and complete time series.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized historical website traffic patterns to identify seasonality, trends, and anomalies.  
   - Aggregated traffic data for meaningful analysis.  

3. **Stationarity Check**  
   - Conducted stationarity checks to assess data suitability for time series modeling.  
   - Stabilized trends and variances for improved forecasting accuracy.  

4. **Model Selection**  
   - Selected **Facebook Prophet** for its ability to model seasonality, trends, and holidays effectively.  

5. **Model Training and Diagnostics**  
   - Trained the Prophet model using historical traffic data.  
   - Validated model reliability through residual analysis and diagnostics.  

6. **Forecasting**  
   - Predicted daily website traffic for the next 60 days, providing actionable insights for planning.  

7. **Visualization and Insights**  
   - Created interactive visualizations of historical trends and future forecasts using Matplotlib.  
   - Highlighted key growth patterns and peak traffic periods.  

8. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** to ensure robust and accurate forecasting.
